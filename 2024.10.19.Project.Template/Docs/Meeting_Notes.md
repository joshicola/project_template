# Meeting Notes

When meeting with a client or team, it is a good idea to take notes. These notes can be used to create a record of the meeting and to ensure that everyone is on the same page. They can also be used to create a list of action items that need to be completed before the next meeting.

### Subentry 1: A random thought

This is a random thought that I had during the meeting. It is a good idea to write it down so that I don't forget it.
