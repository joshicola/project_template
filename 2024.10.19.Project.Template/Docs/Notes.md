# Project Notes

This file contains notes on the project. It is a good idea to write down any thoughts or ideas that you have about the project so that you don't forget them. It constitutes a "mineable" resource to search through and a basis for an LLM Q&A system.  An automated table of contents can be generated from the Markdown-All-in-One extension in Visual Studio Code.
